# 🚀 Welcome to THE STAR WARS

## 🧠 What is this?

Great question. If you figure it out, please let me know.
Until then, let's assume it's a very important app that does very important things.

## 🛠️ How to Run It Like a Pro

Fire up your terminal, buckle up, and follow the sacred ritual:

```bash
npm i
yarn install
```
Translates to: “Dear Node, please shower me with your packages.”

```bash
npm start
yarn dev
```
Now we're cooking. The server's waking up, stretching its limbs.

Then, bravely venture to:

👉 [[http://localhost:5173/star-wars/](http://localhost:5173/star-wars/)]
(Yes, localhost. Because global domination starts at home.)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This code was written with at least 3 cups of coffee and a questionable amount of sleep.
No bugs were harmed in the making of this app — they’re all alive and well.
